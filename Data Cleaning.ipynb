    "### Data frames\n",
    "A data frame is one of the most common data structures available in Python. Data\n",
    "frames are very similar to the tables in a spreadsheet or a SQL table. In Python\n",
    "vocabulary, it can also be thought of as a dictionary of series objects (in terms of\n",
    "structure). A data frame, like a spreadsheet, has index labels (analogous to rows)\n",
    "and column labels (analogous to columns). It is the most commonly used pandas\n",
    "object and is a 2D structure with columns of different or same types. Most of the\n",
    "standard operations, such as aggregation, filtering, pivoting, and so on which can\n",
    "be applied on a spreadsheet or the SQL table can be applied to data frames using\n",
    "methods in pandas.\n",

    "### Delimiters \n",
    "A delimiter is a special character that separates various columns of a dataset from\n",
    "one another. The most common (one can go to the extent of saying that it is a default\n",
    "delimiter) delimiter is a comma (,). A .csv file is called so because it has comma\n",
