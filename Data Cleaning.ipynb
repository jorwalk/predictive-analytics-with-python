    "## Reading the data – variations and examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data frames\n",
    "A data frame is one of the most common data structures available in Python. Data\n",
    "frames are very similar to the tables in a spreadsheet or a SQL table. In Python\n",
    "vocabulary, it can also be thought of as a dictionary of series objects (in terms of\n",
    "structure). A data frame, like a spreadsheet, has index labels (analogous to rows)\n",
    "and column labels (analogous to columns). It is the most commonly used pandas\n",
    "object and is a 2D structure with columns of different or same types. Most of the\n",
    "standard operations, such as aggregation, filtering, pivoting, and so on which can\n",
    "be applied on a spreadsheet or the SQL table can be applied to data frames using\n",
    "methods in pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Delimiters \n",
    "A delimiter is a special character that separates various columns of a dataset from\n",
    "one another. The most common (one can go to the extent of saying that it is a default\n",
    "delimiter) delimiter is a comma (,). A .csv file is called so because it has comma\n",
    "separated values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Various methods of importing data in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "### Case 1 – reading a dataset using the read_csv method\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The read_csv method\n",
    "The name of the method doesn't unveil its full might. It is a kind of misnomer in\n",
    "the sense that it makes us think that it can be used to read only CSV files, which is\n",
    "not the case. Various kinds of files, including .txt files having delimiters of various\n",
    "kinds can be read using this method.\n",
    "```\n",
    "pd.read_csv(filepath, sep=', ', dtype=None, header=None,\n",
    "skiprows=None, index_col=None, skip_blank_lines=TRUE, na_filter=TRUE)\n",
    "```\n",
    "* `filepath`: filepath is the complete address of the dataset or file that you\n",
    "are trying to read. The complete address includes the address of the directory\n",
    "in which the file is stored and the full name of the file with its extension.\n",
    "Remember to use a forward slash (/) in the directory address. Later in this\n",
    "chapter, we will see that the filepath can be a URL as well.\n",
    "* `sep:` sep allows us to specify the delimiter for the dataset to read. By default,\n",
    "the method assumes that the delimiter is a comma (,). The various other\n",
    "delimiters that are commonly used are blank spaces ( ), tab (|), and are called\n",
    "space delimiter or tab demilited datasets. This argument of the method also\n",
    "takes regular expressions as a value.\n",
    "* `dtype:` Sometimes certain columns of the dataset need to be formatted to\n",
    "some other type, in order to apply certain operations successfully. One\n",
    "example is the date variables. Very often, they have a string type which\n",
    "needs to be converted to date type before we can use them to apply daterelated\n",
    "operations. The dtype argument is to specify the data type of the\n",
    "columns of the dataset. Suppose, two columns a and b, of the dataset need to\n",
    "be formatted to the types int32 and float64; it can be achieved by passing\n",
    "`{'a':np.float64, 'b'.np.int32}` as the value of dtype. If not specified, it\n",
    "will leave the columns in the same format as originally found.\n",
    "* `header:` The value of a header argument can be an integer or a list.\n",
    "Most of the times, datasets have a header containing the column names.\n",
    "The header argument is used to specify which row to be used as the header.\n",
    "By default, the first row is the header and it can be represented as header\n",
    "=0. If one doesn't specify the header argument, it is as good as specifying\n",
    "header=0. If one specifies header=None, the method will read the data\n",
    "without the header containing the column names.\n",
    "\n",
